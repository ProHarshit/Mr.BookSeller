Jin-Jin and Eli were best of friends. They even liked the same things. Despite being similar, Jin-Jin believed that Eli was better in every possible way. She thought that her mom picks on her simply because she wasn’t as good as Eli. She started to hate her mom, and began to feel envious of Eli and his perfect life.
Everything changed when Eli’s parents sent a mysterious mirror. Being the curious children that they were, Jin-Jin and Eli just had to check it out. The seemingly boring artifact sucked them in and transported them into another world. There, they had to choose between two things – to live a different life, or to return to those who love them.
What was their decision? Did Jin-Jin continue to hate her mom, or did the experience change her feelings? Was Eli’s life really perfect? Discover the answers to those questions by reading The Mirror of Z!
